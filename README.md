# Ziyuan Zhu - Text Mining Assignment

# Project Overview

From part 1, I found my data source from Project Gutenberg, specifically, A Apple Pie by Kate Greenaway. For this data source, I used two techniques: characterizing by word frequencies and computing summary statistics. My goal was to use a dictionary and calculate frequencies of words in the text. Another goal I had was to figure out the top 10 words in the text.
Another data source that I pulled was from Wikipedia. I wanted to analyze the page for You, which is a Netflix-hit television show. For this data source, I used Natural Language Processing. My goal was to create sentiment analysis and evaluate the results. 

# Implementation 


# Results

For the first data source, I struggled a lot in terms of filtering my book from Project Gutenberg. The book I chose to analyze was a book that taught children the alphabet. However, there was a lot of excess information located in the beginning and end of the book that I hoped to filter out. This definitely skewed my calculations as it had a lot more data than it should. Going forward, I would like to learn how to effectively filter out certain unnecessary information. Overall, it was not a hard task since I am familiar with the dictionary from learning in class. 
For the second data source, I initially struggled a lot with running the command prompt. But, I was able to figure out that I had installed two Pythonâ€™s, in which I got rid of the one downloaded from the Microsoft store. Although it was a little hard to grasp the concept of Natural Language Processing at first, I was able to conduct sentiment analysis.
